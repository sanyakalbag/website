I created this fall wreath by using a wreath form and ribbons. Additionally, I added embellishments and secured them with hot glue. During COVID-19, which is around the time that I made this wreath, many people would notice the wreath that I made and it brought joy to them. I am passionate about creating things and feel so honored when others appreciate and find joy in my work.
