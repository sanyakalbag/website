### Hello, Iâ€™m **Sanya Kalbag**

I am a student at Bridgewater High School and am passionate about spreading joy to others through my artistic abilities. I love to create crafts, sing, and bake as well. I am a involved choir member and have won several singing competitions. Additionally, I have conducted crafting classes to share and spread my love of art with others around me. I also acknowledge the importance of education and am a 4 time honor role student and an active learner. I have been awarded numerous character appreciation awards from the school including the Citizenship Award and Patriot Path certificates by teachers. Being engaged with my community has always been important to me and you can often find me volunteering at local areas.
